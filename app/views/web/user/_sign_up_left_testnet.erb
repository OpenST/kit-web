          <p>
            You will mint your own Branded Tokens on OpenST test side blockchains, by staking <%= ost_currency_symbol %> on Ethereum testnet.
            <%= ost_currency_symbol %> is a test version of the OST cryptocurrency that tracks the public market value of OST for the purpose of testing.
            <%= ost_currency_symbol %> has no real value.
            In alpha, your Branded Tokens are only tradable within your ecosystem.
            The staking of <%= ost_currency_symbol %> functions as a reserve, backing the value of your tokens.

        OST KIT⍺ operates in a test environment. Transactions are not real and the cryptocurrency that changes hands has no real value.
      </p>
      <p class="important-notes p-2 m-0">
        MetaMask is required to participate. You will use MetaMask on <%= ost_valuechain_text %> to sign for token creation transactions.
      </p>
      <p class="important-notes p-2 m-0">
        There is no user-facing wallet in alpha. You will simulate transactions from the company perspective only.
      </p>
      <p class="important-notes p-2 m-0">
        You will get an initial allotment of <%= ost_currency_symbol %>. You can request additional <%= ost_currency_symbol %> as needed.
      </p>
      <p class="important-notes p-2 m-0">
        You can use OST PRICER, our price oracle, to fix prices in USD for transactions in your community.
      </p>
      <p class="important-notes p-2 m-0">
        There are no price stabilisation features implemented in alpha. The value of your tokens will fluctuate with the market price of OST.
      </p>
      <p class="important-notes p-2 m-0">
        There is no cashing-out or exchanging of Branded Tokens in alpha. In the future, holders of your token will have a legal right to the staked OST backing your token, enabling them to cash out or exchange one Branded Token for another.
